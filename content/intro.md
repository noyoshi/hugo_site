I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence,_Kansas" target="_blank">Lawrence, Kansas</a>, where I went to a small episcopal school that had had trailer home for some classrooms. One of few members of my 28 person graduating class to go out of state, I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.
